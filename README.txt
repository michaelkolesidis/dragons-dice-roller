==========================================================

Dragon's Dice Roller aims to be a lightweight, simple, 
reliable and easy-to-use dice roller for RPG games.


How to Use
==========
When the program starts, you are promted to enter the type
of dice you want to be rolled and how many times. You should
provide two integer numbers seperated by a space. The first 
number corresponds to the type of dice and the second to the
number of dice to be rolled.

For instance, the input "6 3" will give you the result of the
D6 dice rolled three times (or three D6 dive rolled at the same
time).

After the result of the roll appears on screen, you can enter
two numbers again for the next roll.

You can exit the program by entering 0 as either the first or
the second number (or both).



Supported Types of Dice
=======================

Input  Dice
 4	D4
 6	D6
 8	D8
 10	D10
 12	D12
